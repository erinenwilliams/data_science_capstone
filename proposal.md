# Data Science Capstone Project

### The problem and data set
Approximately 10-15% of students drop out of Turing before completing the course. I will use Turingâ€™s enrollment database (600 students) and application database (1000+ applicants) to analyze student demographics and key reasons for dropping out to determine if there are any risk factors/ what the risk factors are for drop-outs and repeats.
 
### Guiding questions:
What are the factors that lead to students dropping out of the program? Which factors can I control?
 
### Why do we care about the problem?
This is an interesting and important problem to solve because as a non-profit, we are driven entirely by student tuition. Reducing the rate of drop outs helps keep us financially solvent and keeps student satisfaction high. We hope to use this information to refine the admissions process and reduce the rate of drop-outs and repeaters.

### Approach
I will create a prediction model using R which can forecast the probability of dropping out based on data-based student profiles. This can then be used to inform admissions decisions. 

### Deliverables 
Code and slide deck.
