Draft One:

1. What are risk factors that lead to students dropping out?
2. How can we screen for these risk factors in the interview process?
   + How can we improve the admissions process to mitigate these factors earlier? 
3. How can we predict a student's likelihood of success in the program?
4. How can we support students who meet demographic risk factors that we still want to admit to the program?
5. Can we calculate a student's likelihood of repeating and support them accordingly? 

Draft Two (7/6):

1. Students with which demographic characteristics are most likely to drop out? (race, gender, logic scores, payment plan)
2. What are the "success rates" of different interviewers?
3. Are students with higher logic scores more likely to be successful completing the program? 
4. Are there factors which make a student more likely to repeat?
5. Can we calculate a student's likelihood of repeating and support them accordingly?
